# EKS Terraform Scenarios

This archive contains multiple scenario folders for testing EKS cluster creation using the Rafay provider schema. Each folder contains:

- `resource.tf` — resource definition for the scenario
- `variables.tf` — variables with base defaults
- `README.md` — short notes for the scenario

**Note:** These files are examples for automation testing. They may need provider credentials and slight adjustments before `terraform apply`.
